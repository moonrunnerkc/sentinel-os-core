# Sentinel OS Core

Sentinel OS is an offline-first cognitive operating core for synthetic intelligence systems. It provides a modular foundation for autonomous reasoning, persistent memory, local introspection, and adaptive goal evaluation. The system is designed to run in constrained environments without internet access, while supporting high-level decision-making, memory replay, and task mutation.

## Project Status

This repository is under active development. All source code, models, and architectural modules are being incrementally built and tested in alignment with funded research objectives. The first implementation focus is the Autonomic Distributed Cognition System (ADCS), submitted for NSF and IQT review.

## Core Features

- **Belief Ecology Engine**: Self-regulating cognitive memory structure with contradiction tracing.
- **Recursive Contradiction Tracer**: Identifies and logs internal conflicts across memory and reasoning chains.
- **Goal Collapse Engine**: Manages conflicting goal trees and adapts behavior accordingly.
- **Local LLM Interface**: Operates without cloud APIs. Supports lightweight local model execution and response generation.
- **Memory Layer (Persistent)**: Structured episodic memory system with replay, mutation, and filtering.
- **Graph Introspection Module**: Visualizes internal logic nets, contradictions, and goal evolution over time.
- **Secure Sandbox Layer**: Prevents unauthorized memory overwrites and locks critical internal operations.

## Why It Matters

Current AI systems rely heavily on external APIs, cloud dependencies, or continuous fine-tuning. Sentinel OS is designed to operate in closed-loop, disconnected, or adversarial environments. Its core logic allows for persistent reasoning, contradiction self-diagnosis, and modular identity evolution — even offline.

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1** – Completed:
   - Initial architecture and subsystem planning.
   - NSF and IQT submissions with detailed system blueprint.

2. **Phase 2** – In Progress:
   - Core modules under active development.
   - Local introspection and persistent memory layer nearing first working prototype.

3. **Phase 3** – Scheduled:
   - Real-world testing in isolated containers.
   - Offline deployment simulation and adversarial condition trials.

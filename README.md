# Sentinel OS Core

**Sentinel OS Core** is a modular offline-first cognitive operating system for autonomous software agents. Built to operate in denied environments, it provides persistent memory, self-evolving reasoning, agent orchestration, and programmatic introspection. Sentinel is designed for security-critical, isolated environments such as forward operating field deployments, embedded systems, and autonomous research infrastructure.

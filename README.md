# Sentinel OS Core

> Autonomous. Secure. Offline-Capable.

This is the core module of **Sentinel OS**, a next-generation operating core built for:

- 🧠 Memory-persistent AI agents  
- 🔒 Air-gapped, zero-trust environments  
- 🛰️ Defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure resilience  
- ⚙️ Offline-first cognitive autonomy

---

## 👁️‍🗨️ Mission

Sentinel OS Core enables resilient autonomous systems by giving agents:

- Modular offline intelligence
- Native introspection + belief ecology memory
- Secure, deterministic behavior in hostile or disconnected environments

---

## 🔧 Current Capabilities

- Core agent memory and mutation framework
- Modular belief ecology + contradiction tracing
- Local goal/collapse engine (no cloud dependency)
- JSON-based introspection + state logs

---

## 📍 Roadmap

| Milestone | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Cognitive memory engine | ✅ Complete |
| Goal mutator + contradiction tracing | ✅ Done |
| Logic graph visualizer (introspection UI) | 🔄 In progress |
| Secure CLI interface (air-gapped use) | 🔜 Coming soon |
| SentinelOS full deployment bundle | 🔜 Milestone Q3 |
